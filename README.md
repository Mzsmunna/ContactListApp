# ContactListApp
I Done this project while I was learning Java back in 2017. It's a Simple Contact List App for Desktop where you add, delete , update and search Contact also you can see the call log based on recent time.
It's a GUI Based Applicationa and my 1st Desktop Application using GUI. I used JSwing to implement the GUI Interface. Everything was raw coded here. No IDE was Used. I used Sublime text to bulid this entire Project.
