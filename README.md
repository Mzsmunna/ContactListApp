# ContactListApp
I Done this project while I was learning Java back in 2017. It's a Simple Contact List App for Desktop where you add, delete , update and search Contact also you can see the call log based on recent time.
It's a GUI Based Applicationa and my 1st Desktop Application using GUI. I used JSwing to implement the GUI Interface. Everything was raw coded here. No IDE was Used. I used Sublime text to bulid this entire Project.  
To run this Project you need JRE. Using which java runs in all platforms. you basically have to Install JVM in your Mechine to run the Project.
you also need MySQL running on your Computer as it's based upon PHPMySql and you need to import the contact.sql file.
Then clone/Download the project. Go to Project directory. Open Command Promt in the Directory and type command 'javac Startup.java' press Enter and then again type 'Java Startup' and prerss Enter to run the Project.
